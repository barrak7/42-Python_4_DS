# 42-Python_4_DS
42's Python For Data Science BootCamp

In this short bootcamp I revisited some of the concept which I was already introduced to in 42's Python BootCamp.

Some of the concept which the two cover are:

1 - Basics: basic data structure manipulation
2 - Array: Introduction to numpy arrays and basic practical use cases in simple data science problems.
3 - Data visualization: Reading data from csv files and visualizing it.
4 - Object Oriented Programming: Classes, Inheritance, decorators and many more OOP concepts.
5 - Data oriented design: Focus on effecient use of data to improve performance.
