### steps to create a package:
1 - Create a directory of your package and give it a name of your choice. This directory can include other subpackages too.
2 - create an '__init__.py' file in the package directory.
3 - Add your modules i.e. add your python files.
4 - create a 'setup.py' file. It contains information about your package, such as the name, version, description, author, dependencies and so on.
5 - Use the 'setuptools' to build and distribute the package. To do so, run the 'setup.py' script with the 'sdist' command. This creates a source distribution archine that can be installed using 'pip' or other package managers.
